Hi Arul,

Getting error saying The method getScreenshotAs(OutputType<File>) is undefined for the type TakesScreenshot
in import statement getting error "The import org.openqa.selenium.TakesScreenshot conflicts with a type defined in the same file"

		WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
		driver.get("http://google.com");
		TakesScreenshot screenshot=(TakesScreenshot)driver; //compilation error not shown here
		File source=screenshot.getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);  //compilation error shown here
		driver.close();
